Welcome to tuxnet! The TuxNet Project is a website dedicated to hacking, open/free software, safe web development 
& software related events(all dummy for now, but feature some cool cats).

The idea is to have a centralized place to read & have all the things hackers cant forget. 

#HOW TO RUN

If you care to run tuxnet:

1. Clone project to your local server directory (I placed mine inside MAMP's htdocs dir) ;

2. access localhost/tuxnet 

Hope you like Linux!
