Welcome to tuxnet! This page is dedicated to my favorite programmers & penguins. Without Tux & Linux, the world would be a much less safer place. 

#HOW TO RUN

If you care to run tuxnet:

1. Clone project to your local server directory (I placed mine inside MAMP's htdocs dir) ;

2. access localhost/tuxnet 

Hope you like Linux!
